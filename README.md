# Thread Age

`v0.1.0` - An N1 plugin to display a thread badge indicating its age.

### Why does this exist?

I built this because I tend to leave messages in my inbox with the intention of responding later. Sometimes that doesn't happen in a reasonable amount of time, so Thread Age is here to visually light a fire under my ass.

## Installation

1. Of course you'll need to [get N1](https://nylas.com/n1) first.
2. Clone this repository.
3. On the N1 menu, select `Developer > Install a Plugin...` from the dialog.
4. Find the directory for this plugin to install it.

Done! Thread Age is now installed with some sensible defaults, but you can also go to the new Preferences tab to customize things like badge style, time thresholds, and where badges should appear.
